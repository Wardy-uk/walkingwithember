Walking with Ember brings together curated UK hiking routes and story-led posts for walkers who want straightforward planning.

At the heart of it, this started as shared hill days with Ember: quiet miles, steady climbs, and the simple reset that comes from being outdoors.

We focus on:

- Accurate distance and difficulty notes
- Parking and access tips
- GPX and map links
- Honest post-walk reflections
