**Quiet Miles and Untrodden Paths. Soulful miles with Ember.**

Welcome to **Walking with Ember**. This site is for UK hikers who want clear route planning details, practical notes, and honest post-walk insights.

Hi, I'm Nick and this is Ember, my hiking dog. We love wandering the hills, finding quiet spots, and enjoying the fresh air. Here we share walk routes, trail notes, and stories from the miles that matter.

Most of these walks are logged for headspace and balance, not just stats.

Use the `Walks` section to filter routes by distance, difficulty, region, dog-friendliness, and tags.
