This route links wide moorland paths with the edge itself, making it a strong half-day option for walkers who want scenery without technical terrain.

## Route notes

Start from Upper Burbage Bridge and follow bridleways toward Higger Tor. The loop tracks north along edge-top paths before circling back on lower-level trails.

## Terrain and conditions

- Stone and compacted earth trails
- Exposed in poor weather
- Can be boggy after heavy rain
