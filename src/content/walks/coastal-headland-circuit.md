This circular route is best in settled weather and offers long sea views for most of the outing.

## Route notes

Leave the harbour, follow clifftop rights of way northbound, then return inland through farm tracks and lane connections.

## Terrain and conditions

- Wind-exposed sections
- Uneven clifftop path in places
- Keep distance from unstable cliff edges
