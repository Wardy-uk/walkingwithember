Difficulty labels are only useful when they combine distance, ascent, terrain, and exposure.

## Our simple framework

- **Easy**: short routes, limited ascent, mostly clear paths
- **Moderate**: longer distance or steeper ground with more route attention
- **Hard**: sustained ascent, rough terrain, or exposed sections

Always check forecast, terrain conditions, and daylight in addition to the route grade.
